    "text": "1 Introduction\nCoups are a subject that political scientists have studied for a long time. Characterized by their sudden and violent nature, they unlawfully seize power from governments and cast huge impact on people’s lives - not only within the territory but also in the states closely connected to it. Hence, understanding coups becomes a crucial task, as it could help scholars as well as stakeholders make decisions in advance to get ready for the upcoming political or geopolitical crises. For instance, government officials could prepare policies ahead of time to respond to the new geopolitical environment, and investors could make plans in order to avoid economic loss.\nIn this project, we will examine regime types of countries during coups as a contributing factor to the coup events. Regimes can be broadly categorized into democracies, non-democracies, and interim governments, and example types include presidential democracy, oligarchy, warlordism, etc. Given a historical list of past coup events, we examine how regime types share similarities (cluster) or differences (outlier) from each other.\nBeyond this, the research seeks to discover other noticeable patterns within the coup data along the investigation process, thus contributing to a more detailed understanding of the dynamics between coups and their implications for geopolitical stability. Through this analysis, we hope to provide insights that may contribute to forecasting coup occurrences."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe project makes use of datasets from the following sources:\n\nCoup d’État Project (CDP)\nRulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance dataset (REIGN)\n\n\n2.1.1 The CDP Data\nThe CDP data is collected by the Cline Center for Advanced Social Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It was a collaborative work by Buddy Peyton, Joseph Bajjalieh, Dan Shalmon, Michael Martin, Jonathan Bonaguro, and Scott Althaus.\nThe data is stored in a CSV file. In its latest version, the dataset identifies 981 coup events from 1945 to 2022. For each coup instance, the country and the date it took place, the outcome (whether it is realized, unrealized, or a thwarted conspiracy), the type of its initiator (e.g. military, rebels) as well as the fate the deposed leader (e.g. jailed, fled) are recorded. In total, there are 22 attributes.\nOn average, it is updated every 6 months, starting from November 16th, 2022 to February 23rd, 2023.\n\n\n2.1.2 The REIGN Data\nThe REIGN data is collected by Curtis Bell, Clayton Besaw, and Matthew Frank and stored in a CSV file. The dataset is concerning the political leadership, regime attributes, and electoral results for every country dating back to January 1950. In total, the dataset includes 137,219 observations by January 2021 with 41 descriptive features. The features can be generally classified into 3 groups - political leader characteristics, elections and leader change, and government characteristics. Some noticeable continuous variables are:\n\nage: the national leader’s age\ntenure_months: the number of months a national leader has been in power during their current tenure\nlastelection: an inverted decay function that measures the time since the last election for the leadership position of the country\ndem_duration: the logged number of months a country has had a democratic government\npolitical_violence: the relative level (Z-score) of political violence experienced within the borders of a country for that year\nprecip: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for each country month\ncouprisk: an estimated probability of the risk of a military coup attempt taking place in that month\npctile_risk: the percentile risk for each country’s estimated risk of a military coup attempt that month\n\nThe dataset also identifies the regime type for each country at a particular time. On average, the dataset has been updated for 30 times starting from February 7th, 2019 to August 3rd, 2021.\n\n\n2.1.3 References\nYou may access more informative data descriptions with codebooks for the CDP and the REIGN (download links provided at the end of both pages) data, and you may import the latest version to the local environment for the CDP and the REIGN data. Note: due to maintenance issues, the REIGN data cannot be downloaded directly from their website but can be obtained through GitHub.\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Import & Cleaning\nWe plan to download the data to our local environments and then merge them using SQL functions provided in the sqldf package, on keys country, year, and month. The precise import and cleaning steps are given in later sections.\nBecause both datasets keep track of events happening in the early last century, it can be expected that they contain many missing values. Also, as we have observed, sometimes country names do not match in both datasets. Therefore, we need to clean the data in the preprocessing procedure."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nWe merge the two datasets to provide a more comprehensive picture on the political backgrounds of the coups. Using a left join from the REIGN data to the CDP data, we introduce additional information such as the type of government, coup risk, level of political violence, among many others at the time of the coup. With the merged dataset, we seek to answer the questions posed in the introduction in the following ways:\n\nData Exploration: We will visualize the distribution of all features using a variety of plots – barplots, scatterplots, Cleveland dot plots – as appropriate to gain an initial understanding to the data we are working with. This will allow us to decide what features to pay special attention to in the following steps.\nClustering: We will apply PCA to the numerical features mentioned above (added from the REIGN) data to perform dimension reduction before drawing the biplot. We will then be able to see clusters of the different types of government at the time of the coups and identify any outliers. Depending on whether the clusters are clear, we will also be able to infer if the type of government is highly correlated with coups happening. On the other hand, the biplot also provides insight into highly correlated and uncorrelated features, if there are any.\nTime series analysis: Since the data we have range from 1945 to 2020, it provides a great opportunity for us to conduct time series analysis. We plan to at least group the coups by type of government and by region, respectively, to see if the number of coups changed over the span of 75 years. We will also conduct additional time series analysis for any notable factors that stand out from the previous biplot."

at our joined dataset with the same number of observations as the original main dataset, previously referred to as the CDP data. Out of all our features, couprisk and pctile_risk both have 446 missing values, and all other features have 73 missing values. From the above graph, we can see that roughly 1/3 of the coup observations do not have information concerning the regime type and other numerical attributes. Given that a lot of coups are from many years ago, it is not shocking that a lot of data is missing."
