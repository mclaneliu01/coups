    "title": "Regime Types Under Coups",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nCoups are a subject that political scientists have studied for a long time. Characterized by their sudden and violent nature, coups unlawfully seize power from governments and cast huge impact on people’s lives - not only within the territory but also in the states closely connected to it. This makes understanding coups a crucial task, as it could help scholars as well as relevant stakeholders make decisions in advance to get ready for the upcoming political or geopolitical crises. For instance,\n\ngovernment officials could prepare policies ahead of time to respond to the new geopolitical environment, and\ninvestors could make plans in order to avoid economic loss.\n\nIn this project, we will examine regime types of countries experiencing coups as a contributing factor to the coup events as well as their results. In general, regimes - the form of governments - can be categorized into democracies, non-democracies, and interim governments. Examples of sub-categories include presidential democracy, oligarchy, warlordism, so on and so forth.\nGiven a historical list of past coup events (1945 - 2022), we explore the role of regime types during coups in relation to various other factors. For instance, how did political stability change across regime types? What distinguished attributes did the rulers have under different forms of government? Also, we want to examine how regimes behave differently - or similarly - during coups provided some set of factors: are parliamentary democratic governments similar to presidential democratic governments? Are democratic governments and autarchic governments on the opposite ends with respect to political violence?\nBeyond this, the project studies how statistics of coup events varied across time and space. In our generation, we probably feel that coups are less likely to happen these days comparing to, let’s say, the 70s. However, is that true? Will coups ultimately stop happening across the globe as we - or a small portion of us - are living a better and better life, or are they inevitable events due to human nature?"

Out of all our features, couprisk and pctile_risk both have 446 missing values, and all other features have 73 missing values. From the above graph, we can see that roughly 1/3 of the coup observations do not have information concerning the regime type and other numerical attributes. Given that a lot of coups are from many years ago, it is not shocking that a lot of data is missing."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe project makes use of datasets from the following sources:\n\nCoup d’État Project (CDP)\nRulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance dataset (REIGN)\n\n\n2.1.1 The CDP Data\nThe CDP data is collected by the Cline Center for Advanced Social Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It was a collaborative work by Buddy Peyton, Joseph Bajjalieh, Dan Shalmon, Michael Martin, Jonathan Bonaguro, and Scott Althaus.\nThe CDP data is about coup instances. For each instance, it records information concerning\n\nwhen and where it took place,\nthe type of its initiator (e.g. military, rebels),\nthe coup outcome (realized or not, or it is just a thwarted conspiracy),\nthe fate of the deposed leader (e.g. jailed, fled).\n\nIn its latest version, this dataset identifies 981 coup instances with 22 attributes from 1945 to 2022 and is in the CSV format. On average, new instances and attributes are updated every 6 months, starting from November 16th 2022 to February 24rd 2023.\n\n\n2.1.2 The REIGN Data\nThe REIGN data is collected by Curtis Bell, Clayton Besaw, and Matthew Frank in the CSV format. In general, it contains data concerning\n\nthe political leadership,\nthe regime characteristics,\nthe electoral outcomes\n\nfor every country around the globe since January 1950. Each aspect is described through numerous measures in the dataset, and in total, this massive dataset has 137,219 observations with 41 descriptive features by January 2021. Some noticeable numerical features are:\n\nage: the national leader’s age\ntenure_months: the number of months a leader has been in power\nlastelection: an inverted decay function that measures the time since the last election for the leadership position of the country\ndem_duration: the logged number of months a country has had a democratic government\npolitical_violence: the relative level (Z-score) of political violence experienced within the borders of a country for that year\nprecip: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for each country month\ncouprisk: an estimated probability of the risk of a military coup attempt\n\nNotice that the REIGN is not coup-specific. It is a supporting source that helps us better describe the political ecosystem of a country experiencing coups. So far, this dataset has been updated for 30 times starting from February 7th, 2019 to August 3rd, 2021.\n\n\n2.1.3 References\nYou may access more informative data descriptions with codebooks for the CDP and the REIGN data (download links provided at the end of both webpages), and you may download the latest data to your local environment for the CDP and the REIGN data.\nNote: due to maintenance issues, the REIGN data cannot be downloaded directly from their website but can be obtained through their GitHub repo.\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Import & Cleaning\nWe have made a copy of the datasets and saved them in the data/raw folder of this project. This makes us - as well as you - to import the data.\nAs mentioned, the REIGN data serves as a supporting role. As a preprocessing step, we will merge the REIGN data with the CDP data using keys country, year, and month and keep instances in the CDP data unique. You may find the merged data in the data/merged folder of this project.\n\n\nCode\n# read both data from the project repo\ncdp &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/raw/Coup data 2.1.2.csv\")\nreign &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/raw/REIGN_2021_8.csv\")\n\n# merged data using keys\nmerged &lt;- cdp %&gt;% \n  left_join(reign, by = c(\"cowcode\"=\"ccode\", \"year\"=\"year\", \"month\"=\"month\")) %&gt;%\n  # duplicates may occur if leadership changed in the year of coups\n  distinct(coup_id, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# export the merged data\nwrite.csv(merged, file = \"./data/merged/coup_data.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nmerged &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/merged/coup_data.csv\")\n\n\nNotice that, because observations in both datasets can be dated long ago, it can be expected that there will be many missing values, and they also depend on the geographical location - countries might not be able to provide data for particular measures at some time. In addition, while our data describes the political aspects of countries in a comprehensive manner, bear in mind that coups are also significantly related to economic and social attributes. Although our data provides no information concerning these, feel free to be inspired and add more features for further studies!"

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan (TODO)\nWe merge the two datasets to provide a more comprehensive picture on the political backgrounds of the coups. Using a left join from the REIGN data to the CDP data, we introduce additional information such as the type of government, coup risk, level of political violence, among many others at the time of the coup. With the merged dataset, we seek to answer the questions posed in the introduction in the following ways:\n\nData Exploration: We will visualize the distribution of all features using a variety of plots – barplots, scatterplots, Cleveland dot plots – as appropriate to gain an initial understanding to the data we are working with. This will allow us to decide what features to pay special attention to in the following steps.\nClustering: We will apply PCA to the numerical features mentioned above (added from the REIGN) data to perform dimension reduction before drawing the biplot. We will then be able to see clusters of the different types of government at the time of the coups and identify any outliers. Depending on whether the clusters are clear, we will also be able to infer if the type of government is highly correlated with coups happening. On the other hand, the biplot also provides insight into highly correlated and uncorrelated features, if there are any.\nTime series analysis: Since the data we have range from 1945 to 2020, it provides a great opportunity for us to conduct time series analysis. We plan to at least group the coups by type of government and by region, respectively, to see if the number of coups changed over the span of 75 years. We will also conduct additional time series analysis for any notable factors that stand out from the previous biplot."
