# Introduction

Coups are a subject that political scientists have studied for a long time. Characterized by their sudden and violent nature, they unlawfully seize power from governments and cast huge impact on people's lives - not only within the territory but also in the states closely connected to it. Hence, understanding coups becomes a crucial task, as it could help scholars as well as stakeholders make decisions in advance to get ready for the upcoming political or geopolitical crises. For instance, government officials could prepare policies ahead of time to respond to the new geopolitical environment, and investors could make plans in order to avoid economic loss.

In this project, we will examine regime types of countries during coups as a contributing factor to the coup events. Regimes can be broadly categorized into democracies, non-democracies, and interim governments, and example types include presidential democracy, oligarchy, warlordism, etc. Given a historical list of past coup events, we examine how regime types share similarities (cluster) or differences (outlier) from each other.

Beyond this, the research seeks to discover other noticeable patterns within the coup data along the investigation process, thus contributing to a more detailed understanding of the dynamics between coups and their implications for geopolitical stability. Through this analysis, we hope to provide insights that may contribute to forecasting coup occurrences.
